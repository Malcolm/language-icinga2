* Add numeric/time units
* Add object methods
* Add multi line string
* Proper capitalization for (object|apply|template) statements and a few
  missing object types
* Some other small fixes

* Adds the majority of the syntax highlighting you'd need, missing a few
  object methods and time/date unit highlighting
